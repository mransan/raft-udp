 * All the outgoing RAFT messages are sent in a dedicated
 * concurrent thread [state.outgoing_message_processing]. The 
 * RAFT protocol nevers requires the sender of a RAFT message to block and wait for any 
 * responses. (In fact that response might never come).
 *
 * In order to send those message concurrently, an [Lwt_stream] is used to decouple
 * the threads which wants to compute the outgoing messages from the one which 
 * actually sends them.  
 * 
 * For the caller of this API sending a response is simply pushing the 
 * response to the stream (immediate). The Lwt scheduler will then 
 * pick it up asynchronously by scheduling [state.outgoing_message_processing]
