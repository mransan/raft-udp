(*
 * Notes on the threading design used in the Client IPC 
 * ---
 *
 * I) Logical decoupling of request handling. 
 *
 * The handling of the request is handled solely by the client of this module. 
 * This module is only concerned with client connection management and
 * decoding/encoding requests/responses. 
 *
 * II) Concurrent processing 
 *
 * In order to also reflect the decoupling above in the threading model, 
 * 2 streams are used:
 * - Request stream: used to push incoming requests to this module client. 
 *   If the module client can't keep up with the flow of request then 
 *   this stream will keep on growing 
 * - Response stream: used by this module client code to queue responses
 *   to be sent. The IPC event loop below will keep on dequeing this 
 *   stream and send each response to the IPC client. 
 *
 * This design allows concurrent IPC computation (connection management, 
 * encoding/decoding..) from request handling (business logic). For instance
 * new requests can be decoded while previous one are being handled by this 
 * module client. 
 *
 * III) Request/Response protocol
 *
 * The protocol between the client process and this server is that each 
 * request has exactly one response. Therefore reading from a client connection
 * is only done either right after the connection is initially established or 
 * when a response has been sent.
 *
 * IV) Threads 
 *
 * - 1 new_connection thread: This threads waits on new connection to be
 * established. 
 * - 1 response thread: This thread keeps poping response from the response
 * stream and send them iteratively
 * - n request thread: Those threads wait on new requests on established
 * connection. 
 *
 * The minimum number of thread is therefore 2 when all client connections
 * have sent new request which have been pushed to the request stream and being
 * processed by this module client. 
 *
 * The maximum number of thread is therefore n + 2 where n is the number of 
 * established client connection. All responses have been sent and it's now
 * up to the client to send the next request. 
 *
 * V) Alternative design 
 *
 * Sending responses (encoding + writing to file descriptor) is done 
 * serially. Each response is poped from the response stream and processed
 * using [Lwt_stream.map_s]. 
 * [Lwt.wait] could be used instead of a stream. This means that the main 
 * event loop will have [1 + n + m] threads (with n threads to read to 
 * wait/read new requests and m threads to wait/write new responses and n 
 * + m = total number of client connections). The effect would be that 
 * responses would be processed concurrently but the main loop would manage 
 * a larger number of thread. This could be particularly important if 
 * one write takes a long time.
 *

   * This is the main client IPC loop.
   *
   * The client IPC is done using TCP. This means that multiple client
   * connection must be concurrently processed along with the main TCP
   * `listen` connection which accepts new connections.
   *
   * Therefore our main event loop waits on a list of [Lwt.t] threads. In
   * this list one of the thread is the accept threads while all the
   * others are Request processing threads.
   *
   * Responses computed by the clients are received sequentially using an [Lwt_stream.t]. 
   * They are also sent sequentially (which could be improved).
